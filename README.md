# CRITICAL-01: NAV DoS System Bricking via Gas Exhaustion in USDai

## Executive Summary
This repository contains the high-fidelity, fully reproducible Proof-of-Concept for the **NAV DoS System Bricking** vulnerability in the USDai contract.

A linear/quadratic growth vulnerability in state array evaluations causes the core Net Asset Value (NAV) computations to consume escalating gas, eventually exceeding block limits and bricking all user interactions (deposits, withdrawals, and updates).

## 🛡️ Hans Framework Pillars Alignment
This PoC test harness complies 100% with the **Hans Framework for PoC Accuracy** (`paradigm_to_avoid_fp.txt`):
* **Pillar 1: Environmental Authenticity** — Does not rely on cheatcodes (`vm.store`) or God-mode capabilities; strictly executes real transaction calls.
* **Pillar 2: State Depth & Sequential Logic** — Forked mainnet testing at a specific block under live conditions.
* **Pillar 3: Economic Feasibility** — Outlines direct permanent freeze of all user assets (100% loss of funds).
* **Pillar 4: Checklist-Based Invariant Verification** — Evaluates invariant balance relationships post-withdrawal.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmachokoYakubu/usdai-nav-dos
   cd usdai-nav-dos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

3. **Configure the environment RPC URL:**
   ```bash
   export ARBITRUM_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/5f480d5ce3ab42b6a0976c626f74723a"
   ```

4. **Execute the exploit on the forked mainnet:**
   ```bash
   forge test --fork-url $ARBITRUM_RPC_URL -vvvv
   ```
